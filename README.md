#Master & Commander
Master & Commander is a reboot of the old Protection paladin addon. 

## Project description
This addon is helping the player to be more in control and give all the information needed to be best at what they do, 
to make their own judgement based on the situation they are playing in.

## Features
- A "protection"-HUD
- Taunt messages to chat
- Aura warnings
- Ability to create some useful/well known macros with one click
- Active statistics bar
- Blessing of Freedom button whenever user is incapacitated or slowed down


### The protection-hud
This is the main interface showing up. This interface will show you how well you are protection against spells and physical attacks. They are based on various 
applied buffs based on their own talents. It will also provide you with an indication of which spells/auras should be active and active cooldowns of buffs like 
`Ardent Defender` and `Guardian of the Ancient King`, etc. Sometimes, when out of range, a `Devotion aura` will also not be available. This will show.

### Taunt message
- Will give the environment a message when you taunted your target. This seems a bit like overkill sometimes, but when more it will be more clear to the people around
you what happened. Supports multi-target taunts under the effect of the talent `Final Stand` and Raid icons.

### Aura warnings
Gives you a warning when in combat and `Crusader Aura` is still on. Or `Devotion Aura` is not on, or already active and you should choose a different one, 
like `Concentration Aura` or `Retribution Aura`.

### Creating macros
There are some famous macros for paladins out there. Like debuff removal macros when using `Blessing of Protection` or `Divine Shield`. As these are crucial,
however not always wanted when having aggro, they should be able to be removed asap. This addon will help you with one-click creation of this macro.

### Active statistics bar
A very thin information bar that can be places just below or on top of your action bar to give you live stats. Bar can be disabled.

### Blessing of Freedom button
When incapacitated or slow downed, it's sometimes very very handy to press `Blessing of Freedom` asap. 
When it's on your action, it can be too slow to find, and having it popping up when needed, may do the trick. Can be annoying within fights 
where other buttons are suddenly are coming up. Can be disabled.


### A cool configuration screen
While addons may sometimes are a bit tricky to use or too complicated, this addon will have a clear and good looking configuration screen, 
to enhance that real Paladin feeling ;-)
